# Surgical Video Bin
This is a *public* repository that is a collection of scripts I have created or found useful in processing surgical video clips or annotations.

# Rules
* Use these scripts at your own risk.
* Keep scripts general, avoid hardcoding paths, env variables, etc.
* Guard your secrets, do not commit API keys or sensitive information.
